# Synology-Interactive-Panel
## Made for Pythonista on iPad Pro 11″ 

I do not expect this to be used by anyone, and am saving this here purely for my own purposes.

A small rundown for anyone who stumbles across this:

Made for Pythonista, programmed on an iPad Pro 11″ and NOT tested on another model.

Can view files, folders, and images.


## NAS Settings

**To connect to your own NAS in the file arguments (Run Options) in pythonista, use this format:**

  <NAS URL> <Port> <Username> <Password> <root>
 
  
  1. NAS URL  >  nasname.synology.me
  
  1. Port  >  Is always 5001, unless configured in NAS settings
  
  1. Username  >  Whatever user you want to use
  
  1. Password  >  Whatever the password is for the user you want to use
  
  1. root  >  Name of the root of the NAS, mine is /Volume, yours maybe different.
