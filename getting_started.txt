To start SiP. Follow these steps (Note: I do recommend you have experience with Python / Synology stuff to use this script, but I will try to make it as easy as I can to use and follow)

To start, open sip-config.cfg (In the same folder as this file)
go to line 20, where it says "login" and within the list of values, replace them in this order with your details.
    URL (Example: yournas.synology.me or just the IP address of where your NAS is hosted)
    Port (Example: the default port for synology nas' is 5001, 5000 also works but is not HTTP. So you should just be able to leave the port alone)
    User (Example: The user you use to login to the NAS with)
    Password (Example: The password of the user you chose)
    Root (Example: The root is where the SiP will first put you when it starts. It has to be a full path. So something like this "/Volume/Photos/Cats" will be valid, which also means you can just use /Volume as the root. If the root is invalid, SiP will let you know, and of course, the path is case-sensitive.)

open sip.py, press the "Play" button in the top right. And pray it runs!!

~ Some other technical details ~

each JSON key in occ.json is formatted like this:
    "{ID}": [
        "{folder_path}",
        "{ID}-{filename}"
    ]
    
The ID is calulated from two numbers, the timestamp, and the size of the file. I'm not going to explain how to find those values out because I actually don't know how to without code. (Actual formula: timestamp+size)
